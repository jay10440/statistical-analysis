# Statistical Analysis

This repository contains a collection of statistical analyses and experiments I've worked on. It’s a space where I practice applying different statistical methods and models to various datasets.

## What’s Inside

- Scripts and notebooks exploring hypothesis testing, regression, data visualization, and other common statistical techniques.
- Datasets (where allowed) or links to datasets used in the analyses.
- Notes and comments to explain the approaches and results.

## How to Use

1. Clone this repository: https://github.com/jay10440/statistical-analysis.git
2. Explore the scripts and notebooks using your preferred environment (e.g., Jupyter Notebook, RStudio, Python IDE).
3. Run the code step-by-step to follow the analysis and visualize results.

## Notes

- This is a personal learning and experimentation space, so some projects may be rough or in progress.
- I welcome feedback and suggestions if you want to reach out!
